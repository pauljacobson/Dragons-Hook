## About Dragon's Hook

Dragon's Hook is a text-based game written in Python.

It is a very basic adventure game that I created as part of a learning exercise.

My son thinks it's fun. My plan is to work on it and expand it as I learn more Python.

## How to run Dragon's Hook

At the moment, this game needs to be run from the command line. To run it, navigate to the directory with the file and type the following:
